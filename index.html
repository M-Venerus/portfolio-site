                I'm currently pursuing a full-time Computer Science degree at
                WGU and simultaneously working part-time as an Aircraft
                Maintenance Engineer under my company DynaMain Aerospace Inc.
                While I've built a successful track record in Aviation Technical
                Operations, I'm now passionate about channeling that drive and
                experience into the tech world. My ambition is to continuously
                expand my skillset and transition to a fulfilling career in
                Software Engineering.

                  <p>
                    My curiosity, adventurous character, and willingness to
                    explore drives me to challenge myself and push boundaries. I
                    embrace change and adapt quickly in dynamic environments. My
                    comfort in unfamiliar territory means I am able to think
                    outside of the box to fulfill a role where critical thinking
                    and creativity are imperative.

                  <h3>Strong Work Ethic</h3>
                  <p>
                    More than just putting in long hours, I demonstrate
                    dedication, commitment, and personal responsibility. My
                    strong work ethic means I am intrinsically motivated to take
                    pride in not only my work, but the work of my teammates as
                    well. The payoff of hard work is great, but my preference is
                    when the whole team succeeds.

                  <p>
                    I like when complex ideas can be broken down into digestible
                    bits. I believe doing this accurately is the cornerstone of
                    effective communication and collaboration. Ensuring everyone
                    is able to understand their tasks, along with where and how
                    it fits inside of an aligned vision is paramount to success,
                    and is a strategy I often practice.

                    I believe my thirst for learning is not only a strategy for
                    success, but also a characteristic of my personality. I
                    enjoy the constant pursuit of new knowledge and skills, both
                    within and outside of my fields of expertise. This internal
                    drive means that as a member of a team, I look forward to
                    being both a lifelong mentee and mentor.

                <p>
                  My first language. I like to use Python for its simplicity and
                  versatility, although it's not always performative. I've used
                  it for my first projects, such as my

                  C++ has helped me to gain an understanding of memory
                  management and performance-intensive applications, used in my

            </div>
            <p>
              I am currently a first-year Computer Science student, attending
              Western Governor's University. After 5 years in the aviation
              maintenance field, I chose to change my path going forward, to
              pursue my true interest, technology, as I enrolled back in
              university. Working on some of the most advanced aircraft in the
              world, such as the Boeing 787, helped me realize that instead of
              just fixing these machines, I could instead contribute
              meaningfully to the creation of such projects that help define the
              modern world. So now, as of 2023, I am back in an educational
              setting, with eyes and ears wide open, aiming to make an impact
              wherever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I pivot towards software engineering, I believe that my unique
              background sets me apart. The conscientious nature of aircraft
              maintenance and my past successes have ingrained in me a
              methodical approach and a passion for problem-solving and hard
              work. These qualities translate well into the world of software
              development as debugging and logical troubleshooting come natural
              to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I seek an intern role in this new domain, I bring along not
              just technical proficiency, but also a proven track record of
              dedication and pursuit of excellence. I look forward to the
              opportunities that await, and I eagerly welcome the change in my
              career.

              In the world of aviation, precision, attention to detail, and a
              commitment to continuous learning are paramount. These principles
              have been the foundation of time as an Aircraft Maintenance
              Engineer. The highlights of my career have been receiving my
              professional licence during my 5 years at <b>Air Canada</b>, and
              recently starting my own part-time business,
              <b>DynaMain Aerospace</b>, to stay busy and expand my skillset
              during the beginnings of my Computer Science studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Air Canada, I performed maintenance and technical operations on
              the aircraft fleet. I am endorsed and experience on the B767 and
              A320 family. This came with many responsibilities, including
              adhering to strict protocols, diagnosing and troubleshooting
              complex technical problems, and working collaboratively with
              diverse engineering and fleet management teams. This role
              instilled in me a deep appreciation for the interplay between
              sophisticated machinery and the software systems that drive them.
              It was here that I first recognized the incredible power of
              technology and its potential to transform industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, at my own company, DynaMain Aerospace, I balance the
              roles of leadership and hands-on engineering. I use my AME licence
              to complete work orders for large maintenance facilities by
              inspecting, testing, documenting, and repairing aircraft and
              aircraft components and to certify the completion of work in
              accordance with the applicable engineering documentation. Most of
              my work encompasses 'heavy' maintenance, which means big projects
              with many team members. My past experience and knowledge usually
              provides me with the opportunity to take lead on many of these
              projects. This has honed my project management skills, as I've
              learned to juggle multiple priorities and develop eye for the
              bigger picture, while ensuring that every minute detail is
              accounted for.
