              Thank you for taking a moment to explore my projects. This section
              is under constant development and will expand over time. Here,
              you'll find a collection of projects that I've had the privilege
              to work on during my time so far as a computer science student.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each endeavor presented here has taught me something valuable, not
              just about coding or technology, but also about persistence,
              problem-solving, and collaboration. They're far from perfect, but
              they reflect my growth and the joy I find in creating and
              learning. I hope you find them interesting, and I appreciate any
              feedback or insights you might have to offer.
            </p>

                >DynaMain Aerospace Inc.</a
              >
              is my Aircraft Maintenance Engineering company. I am Toronto
              based, primarily serving AMOs (maintenance facilities) that
              require engineers for large maintenance and modification projects.
              I use my AME licence to complete work orders by inspecting,
              testing, documenting, and repairing aircraft and aircraft
              components and to certify the completion of work in accordance
              with the applicable engineering documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although most of my work contracts were made through industry
              connections, meaning advertising was not necessary, I challenged
              myself to create a website for my business nonetheless where I can
              learn the building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JS, in a way that
              makes my company really stands out. Here is the final result of
              that challenge. It is a static site that provides information
              pertaining to the primary services offered as well as contact
              info. No frameworks were used, only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It
              is fully responsive and will scale excellently across all screen
              sizes, maintaining readability and a sleek design.

                >Class Roster program</a
              >
              is my debut into C++ OOP. It takes input data of student ID, name,
              email, age, days in courses, and degree program. The data is
              parsed and stored in Student objects. I wrote a variety of
              accessor and mutator functions for the Student class. There are
              also data validity checkers for info such as email formatting. A
              second class, the Roster, is used to hold to the Student Objects
              and loop through them to perform specific actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is one of my first university projects and helped me to
              develop my skills and competancies around and using arrays,
              pointers, memory, function, and classes, using the object-oriented
              paradigm. I made sure to pay close attention to detail,
              organization, and to focus my efforts on making the Roster and
              Student classes mechanically sound.

              is built using Python and OOP. It allows users to select a
              beverage type, enter coins, and receive coffee. Some of it's
              features are holding the money from coffee sales, tracking
              inventory of ingredients used to make different types of coffee,
              reporting when resources are low, and a user 'report' function to
              gather info on data stored.

              Ever since I began my journey into the realm of computer science,
              Python has held a special place in my heart. Coding in Python and
              making this simulator along with countless other small projects,
              while learning programming fundamentals, has been a lot of fun.
              The readability, syntax, and versatility of python, evident
              through my projects, has enriched my passion for technology and
              coding and has provided my first true bridge between imagination
              and realization.

              using Python's Turtle module was both educational and
              entertaining. The game is very simple. Simply run main.py inside
              VSCode with Tkinter. The game opens with Turtle graphics, and the
              user can use the arrow keys to change direction of the snake. The
              goal is to eat the blue dots, and eating a dot increases the
              score. As the score increases, so does the speed and size of the snake. Try
              to get as high a score as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized this game and the technologies used to create it were a
              great match after the project was completed. What better way to
              create this simplistic game other than using a concise,
              simplistically written language such as Python, and basic
              graphical tool such as the Turtle module.

            <p>
              While these first few projects stand as a proud testament to my
              commitment and love for learning and using different languages and
              tools, it is just the beginning of a much larger journey. Just as
              technology and programming are in a constant evolution, so are the
              programmers, like myself. Each project has served as a valuable
              learning experience, and while I'm proud of what I've
              accomplished, I remain grounded in the realization that there's so
              much more to master.
            </p>
            <p>
              I approach every project with a blend of enthusiasm and humility.
              I start them with the willingness to learn, adapt, and improve.
              I'm grateful for the opportunities that come my way, and that
              includes building and sharing my projects and skills here. I will
              continue to add projects and update this page as my journey
              marches onwards.
